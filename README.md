# TShirtShooter

This is the project controlling the Team 302 T-Shirt Cannon Demo robot

This robot is currently setup to have two buttons that control shooting the cannons, as well as controls to drive the T-Shirt Cannon.

The button mapping is as follows:

A-Button: Shoots one solenoid and moves to the next

B-Button: Shoots six solenoids at once

Left-Joystick Y-Axis: Throttle control for driving

Right-Joystick X-Axis: Steering control for driving
